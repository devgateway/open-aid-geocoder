The project would, over a period of seven years, establish 6,500 ha of cashew on state and private farms as well as on communal villages; 250 ha of mangoes would also be grown on a state farm. Furthermore, three existing cashew nut processing factories with a combined capacity of 45,000 tons of raw nuts per annum, would be rehabilitated. The main components of the project are crop development, institution building, machinery, equipment, vehicles, project management and technical assistance. Co-financing was provided by the ADF and the ADB loan will be used to finance 66.8 per cent of the foreign exchange cost of the project.",

The project involves the construction of a multi-purpose earth-fill dam with associated major works. When completed, the dam will be 38 m high above the river bed and will create a reservoir with a capacity of 385 million cubic metres. Co-financiers of the project were the ADB, Italy (FUA 8.31 million, Italian Suppliers' Credit (FUA 59.18 million, and the Central Bank of Portugal (FUA 1.79 million). The ADF loan will finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the access road, reservoir clearing, and supervision of the project.",

The project involves the procurement and installation of equipment for the tropospheric scatter system, digital exchanges, and subscriber plant for 10,000 subscribers; and the provision of test instruments, tools, manuals, vehicles, spare parts, maintenance support and training. Co-financing was provided by the NIP and the ADB loan will be used to finance 83.8 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the project.",

Expected Outcomes: By 2007, the public debt unit of the Ministry of Finance will be restructured into three separate departments; new prudential regulations and a supervisory framework for insurance will be passed; new pension funds legislation will be approved; and BSD and IGS staff will be trained. By 2010, the deposit/loan transformation rate of banks will increase to 30 percent, interest rate spreads will be reduced from 20-22 percent to not more than 18 percent; and insurance premiums, as a percentage of GDP, will increase from 1.8 percent to three percent.",

In addition to the high loss of property, thousands of\r\nacres of land were inundated, and essential food crops were ruined, while the incidence of cholera and other water-borne diseases, as well as malaria, increased dramatically.

            "long_description" : "In Mozambique, agriculture contributes over one-third of the gross domestic product, and employs more than three-quarters of the population.  With its favorable climate and soils, the country has considerable potential for increased agricultural production. The development of the sector has lagged, however, partly because rural and feeder roads are in such poor condition.  The lack of reliable, affordable transport makes it difficult for farmers to acquire needed agricultural inputs or to market crops effectively and discourages them from taking additional land under cultivation. Although roads are the primary\r\nmode of transportation in Mozambique, few are paved. Years of civil strife have left bridges and other road infrastructure in a shambles and allowed the paving to deteriorate. These conditions were exacerbated in February 2000, when the worst floods in over 50 years struck, destroying much of the infrastructure. This loan will cofinance a project to promote increased agricultural production by repairing and upgrading severely deteriorated roads in seven rural districts of Gaza and Tete provinces. Under the project, the 137 km-long Chókwè-Macarretane-Lagone Nova road, large portions of which were completely submerged for days, and the 162 km-long Massacama-Columue road will be completely rehabilitated. Unpaved portions will be repaired and upgraded to double bitumen standard, damaged sections will re-built, and drains and culverts cleared and repaired. The carriageways on some sections of the Massacama-Columue road will be widened and shoulders\r\nwill be provided on both sides. Bridges will be repaired or replaced, as necessary. Once the roads have been improved, farmers in this area, which is regarded a potential breadbasket because of its high agricultural potential, will be better motivated to increase food and cash crop production. The communities served by these roads will also benefit. In addition to improved mobility for people and products, the project will also create thousands of temporary jobs during the construction phase, thus providing many households with an additional source of income.

Despite the network of drainage systems, many drains become blocked by silt accumulation, causing frequent flooding during the rainy season and a rapid deterioration of the road surface. The project will address these shortfalls by rehabilitating/constructing some 42.5 km of roads in the city center and suburban districts. Sidewalks will also be added where needed and storm-water drains repaired.  Additionally, 23 bus stations will be renovated and a bus parking area built. The refurbished roads will afford the population easier, swifter access to marketplaces and social services. In addition, improved traffic flow within the city will enhance road safety and reduce transport costs, ultimately helping to boost socio-economic development.  Selling vegetables in Maputo.
